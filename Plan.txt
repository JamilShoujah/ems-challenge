This file servers to demonstrate my thought process while woeking on this project
In other words, it gives insight on what im think, how im thing, and why i chose to do what i did

Basic Plan
1 - complete the app's functionality. Functionality is more important that design when short on time
2 - when functionality is complete, work on the design of the page to improve user experience
3 - if time permits, optimize project, create valid react components for better code reusability and maintenance
4 - if time permits, establish a linting system to force all devs working on project to adopt the same coding style.
5 - if time permits, enhance UI even further (Jamil's note: Assume all users are brain dead, so make a very simple and ituitive UI)


below you will see the steps i have taken throughout the project.
1 - fork original repo and clone fork onto computer
2 - read, understand, explore and test project to get a better feel for the project
3 - establish proper base for the project and check for any errors prior to starting development.
